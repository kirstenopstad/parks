## Description

A student project demonstrating knowledge of building RESTful APIs. This is an API is a __Parks Lookup__: an API for state and national parks. The API will list state and national parks.

***
## Objectives
### Goals
1. Meet MVP
2. [Stretch] Add front end MVC app to consume API
3. [Stretch] Add additional endpoint

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
* Application includes CRUD functionality and successfully returns responses to API calls.
* README thoroughly describes all endpoints along with parameters that can be used.
* Application includes a best effort at implementing at least one of the further exploration objectives: authentication, __versioning__, pagination, or CORS. 
* README includes specific documentation on further exploration: what it is and how to use it.
* Build files and sensitive information are included in .gitignore file and is not to be tracked by * Git, and includes instructions on how to create the appsettings.json and set up the project.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

### Strech Goals (Further Exploration)
1. Add a front end MVC application that consumes your API.
2. Add a RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park/business/animal.
3. Add a second custom endpoint that accepts parameters. Example: a SEARCH route that allows users to search by specific park names.
